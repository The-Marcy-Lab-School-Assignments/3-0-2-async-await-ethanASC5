# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users)
  return users;
}
getUser(-1)
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer
- The function getUser is generally safe in the sense that it performs the basic task of fetching user data from the provided URL. 

# Teacher Feedback

This function is not safe because it is missing all error handling! There are no catch blocks and no way to check if the response is what we needed before moving forward.
